# lit-element-vue
Little test of vue + lit-element

Just to see how easily they mesh together. Which is actually very easy and they go together very well.

### To Run

- clone
- `npm install`
- `npx polymer serve`

It uses polymer serve as the cli provides some nice mapping for node modules - although no bable etc is invoked
